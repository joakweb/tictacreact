## Tic Tac Toe - React Showcase

This is a basic implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using React. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## How to Run

To run the game, first make sure you have **Node.js** installed on your machine. Then, follow these steps:

- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Navigate to the root directory of the project in your terminal.
- Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
- Run `npm start` to start the development server.
- Open your web browser and go to [**http://localhost:3000**](http://localhost:3000) to view the game.

## How it Works

This game was created using React's built-in state management and event handling capabilities. The board is represented as an array of 9 squares, and each square is either "X", "O", or null (for empty squares). When a player makes a move, the corresponding square in the array is updated with their symbol, and the board is re-rendered with the new state.

The game logic is handled by a series of helper functions that check for winning combinations and determine the current player's symbol. The game state is stored in a parent component, which passes down the necessary props to child components as needed.
